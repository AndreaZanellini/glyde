# Changelog

All notable changes to Glyde are documented here.

This file is written for the **maintainer and users, not for developers**: describe
what changes for someone using the app, in plain language. It is the primary way the
maintainer reviews work without reading code. Every PR adds a line here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial repository scaffolding: product/spec/architecture/quality documentation,
  CI matrix for Linux, macOS and Windows, issue templates.

### Fixed
- The two internal crates that make up the app (`glyde-core`, the engine, and
  `glyde-app`, the window you actually run) are now explicitly marked as
  "not published to crates.io", matching the third internal crate
  (`glyde-devtools`) that already was. This has no effect on using the app —
  it only prevents an internal build tool from ever being accidentally
  published as a public library.
- The app now writes a log file every time it runs, in the standard per-OS app-data
  location (e.g. `~/.local/share/Glyde/logs` on Linux, `~/Library/Application
  Support/Glyde/logs` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Glyde\logs` on Windows), in addition
  to printing to the console. There is nothing to see in the app itself yet — this is
  the foundation so that, once real features land, a bug report can include one log
  file that explains what happened, per `docs/SPEC.md` §6.
- Internal groundwork: the engine now has a single, shared way to report a failure
  (a malformed file, an unreadable path, and — as more of the app lands — every other
  kind of failure) instead of each part inventing its own. There is nothing to see in
  the app yet; this is what makes the next features able to fail loudly and clearly
  instead of silently or with a crash, per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §Error philosophy.

### Assumptions made (maintainer: veto by testing)
- The app-data location is resolved as `directories::ProjectDirs::from("com", "glyde",
  "Glyde")`. Neither `docs/SPEC.md` nor `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` specifies the exact
  qualifier/organization/application strings, so I picked a conventional
  reverse-DNS-style identifier. This only affects where the log folder lives on disk;
  it is free to change before release without any user-visible consequence.
- Log files rotate daily (`glyde.log.<date>`) with no retention/pruning yet. Retention
  policy isn't specified anywhere in scope; I judged unbounded daily files
  acceptable for now given how small a log file is expected to be, versus the risk of
  guessing a deletion policy that silently discards evidence a bug report might need.
- The shared error type only has one kind of failure so far (a file that can't be
  read). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` doesn't enumerate the full list up front — more kinds
  (bad encoding, unsupported format, and so on) are added alongside the feature that
  can actually produce them, so the error type never claims to handle a failure no
  code path yet raises.
- The app-boundary test (proving a failure from the engine surfaces correctly to the
  app) lives on its own next to `main.rs` rather than inside a real feature, since no
  feature calls into the engine yet — File→Open lands in M2. It will move once there
  is a real call site to attach it to.
